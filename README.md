## My Solution to Assignments of CS231n Winter2016
This is my solution to three assignments of CS231n Winter2016.<br>
[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition Winter2016](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/) is
a classical class, which teaches you to 
implement, train and debug your own neural networks via python package numpy on Cifar10 datasets. And after finishing the assignments, you can gain a deep understanding of cutting-edge researches in machine learning and computer vision issues. 
******
**Note:** If you consult my source codes that you may want to incorporate into your algorithm or system, you should clearly cite references in your codes.
